What you got:
mock_server.py — Run this on one host (your "fake internet"). It listens on port 80 and responds to HTTP requests for all 20 domains with realistic HTML pages, correct headers, and simulated latency. It logs every hit with the requesting IP.
traffic_gui.py — The main GUI tool. Dark terminal-style interface with:

SSH credential fields (username + password)
IP range input supporting CIDR (192.168.1.0/24), dash ranges (10.0.0.1-50), or comma lists
Mock server IP field
Traffic controls: cycles, delay, thread count
Checkboxes to enable/disable individual domains
Three actions: Deploy & Run (hosts file + traffic), Hosts Only, Remove Hosts (clean cleanup)
Live host status table and scrolling activity log


Quick start:
bash# 1. Install deps on your GUI/control host
pip install paramiko flask

# 2. On your mock server host (needs port 80)
sudo python3 mock_server.py

# 3. Launch the GUI
python3 traffic_gui.py
The /etc/hosts entries are wrapped in clearly marked comments (=== TRAFFIC-SIM START/END ===) so the Remove Hosts button cleanly restores the original file with no residue.
